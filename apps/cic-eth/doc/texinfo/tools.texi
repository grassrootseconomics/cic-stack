@node cic-eth-tools
@section Tools

A collection of CLI tools have been provided to help with diagnostics and other administrative tasks. These use the same configuration infrastructure as the daemons.

Tool scripts are located in the @file{cic_eth.runnable} package. If @var{cic-eth} is installed as a python package, they are installed as executables in @var{PATH}.


@subsection info (cic-eth-info)

Returns self-explanatory metadata for the blockchain network, and optionally an address.


@subsection inspect (cic-eth-inspect)

Returns information about a specific resource related to the tranasaction queue. The results returned depend on the type of the argument.

@table @var
@item lock
If the argument is the literal string @kbd{lock}, it will list all active lock settings currently in effect. (see @strong{[reference locking section]})
@item <address>
If the argument is a 0x-prefixed hex string of 42 characters, it returns all transactions where the specified address is a sender or recipient@footnote{If the address is the gas gifter or the accounts index writer, this may be a @emph{lot} of transactions. Use with care!}
@item <tx_hash>
If the argument is a 0x-prefixed hex string of 66 characters, it returns data from the custodial queueing system aswell as the network for a single transaction whose hash matches the input. Fails if the transaction does not exist in the queue
@item <code>
If the argument is a 0x-prefixed hex string longer than 66 bytes, the argument will be interpreted as raw RLP serialized transaction data, and attempt to match this with an entry in the queue. If a match is found, the result is the same as for @var{<tx_hash>}
@end table


@subsection create (cic-eth-create)

Create a new account, optionally registering the account in the accounts registry, and optionally receiving the newly created address through a redis subscription.

@subsection transfer (cic-eth-transfer)

Execute a token transfer on behalf of a custodial account.

@subsection tag (cic-eth-tag)

Associate an account address with a string identifier. See @strong{[reference SYSTEM ACCOUNTS]}.


@anchor{cic-eth-tools-ctrl}
@subsection ctrl (cic-eth-ctrl)

Set or reset lock bits, globally or per account address.

@subsection resend (cic-eth-resend)

Resend a transaction. This can either be done "in-place," which means increasing the gas price and re-queueing@footnote{this is the same thing that the retrier does}. It can also be used to @emph{clone} a transaction, which obviously will duplicate the effect of the cloned transaction on the blockchain network.
