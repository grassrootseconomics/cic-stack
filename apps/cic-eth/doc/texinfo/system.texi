@section System initialization

When the system starts for the first time, it is locked for any state change request other than account creation@footnote{Specifically, the @code{INIT}, @code{SEND} and @code{QUEUE} lock bits are set.}. These locks should be @emph{reset} once system initialization has been completed. Currently, system initialization only involves creating and tagging required system accounts, as specified below.

See @ref{cic-eth-locking,Locking} and @ref{cic-eth-tools-ctrl,ctrl in Tools} for details on locking.

@subsection System accounts

Certain accounts in the system have special roles. These are defined by @emph{tagging} certain accounts addresses with well-known identifiers.

@item ACCOUNT_REGISTRY_WRITER
This account @strong{must} have access to add newly created account addresses to the (@xref{cic-eth-dependencies-smart-contracts,Smart contract dependencies})
